# ecommerce_singlepage_P1
A single page e-commerce website.

This is my first project done under the Front-End Web Development training and certification course from 1stop.ai and IIT-Kanpur. This is a single page e-commerce website 
that features a hypothetically imagined company Buy-Best dealing in vehicles.

This webpage uses only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The link to access the wepage is- https://maanvitandon.github.io/ecommerce_singlepage_P1/
